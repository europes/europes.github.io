  <p> The fire was up to full heat tonight in Rio as Vasco and Seville played out what was surely the Super league game of the season so far. Vasco were 
   dealt a massive blow before kick off as star striker Haaland was still absent due to coronavirus and 5g chip implantation vaccine surgery so Leao had to step
   up in only his second start of the season. With Balotelli banging them in for Seville in recent games could Leao compete. A tale of two strikers.
      One in red hot form and the other in from the cold. </p> <br>
   
   <p>As expected when these two lock horns it was a night for attack as defenses were lost at sea. Leao dived right in with a quick goal to set the precedings. However, within minutes
    a fanatastic twenty yard strike
  from Ocampos silenced the home fans as it flew into top corner.  No problem for Vasco though. The ship was steadied again as Leao preceded to fire in two more goals for a quick first half
  hat trick. The Samba beat was deafening, there was only one team here tonight and Seville were sinking deep. </p> <br>
  
<p>How could Seville anchor their defense and prevent an onslaught. Seville manager Shaka had the answers! As he has often said "Best form of defense is attack."
	With players like De Bruyne and Balotelli one has to agree with these philosophies and so it was to be as out of
	nowhere they turned the game on its head. 
		Some potent attacking including a thunderous strike for edge of box from main man Balotelli and poor Vasco defense
	got them back in to game for
	3-3. </p> <br>
	    
	    <p>Worse was to follow for the Vasos as despite looking like heading into half time all square a comedy of errors occured as Pepe Reina must have caught the super contagious Liverpool Kariusvirus as he failed to collect the ball twice before it went through his legs leaving
 an easy tap in and a crazy turn around as Seville went from 3-1 down and out to leading at the break.</p> <br>
  
  <p>Could this game get any crazier? A Hamsik goal early into the second period levelled the tie once again but another immediate reply from man of moment Balotelli
quikly restored Sevilles lead. Leao the first half hat trick hero now became villain as he missed two easy chances.
  It looked as if the game was over. Leao had scored three Balotelli only two, he may have lost the goals scoring battle but would be the victorious
	  one. </p></br>
	    
	    <p>The Spanish armada had came to Brazil and conquered but just as they where set to sail home with the three points with Vasos ship all but sunk a last gasp attack sees Griezmann send Leao in to make ammends for recent
  misses and level the tie. Four goals for the young prospect who shows Balotelli who the new goal scoring king is. A great escape but nothing less than the home team desereved and overall a thrilling end to the game. Or was it?
   </p> <br>
    
    <p>Deep into third minute of added time with Vasco happy to take the draw a steal of the ball and quick break. So much space, were Seville going for a late
  winner? It breaks to Greizmann again who slips in fresh super sub and Spanish traitor Castillejo who runs free in on goal for what will surely be last kick of the game.
  A duanting run to the goal seemed to take forever and ElPesidentes hands were surely shaking by this point. </p><br>
	    
	    <p><i>Could he maintain his nerves and   get a cruel late winner? Will he chip? will he finesse? will he blast?
		    will keeper come out? will keeper come out then go back?... then come out then go back again?</i>
  all kind of thoughts running through his mind. </p><br>
	    
	    <p>But he had faith in his man Samu who had escaped the Spanish fleet to make home in Brazil now. He made the decision for him with a well placed finesse into bottom corner.
  It was all over! 6-5 to Vasco! What a sensational game! Leao and Vasco come out on top! Balotelli and Seville fans all at sea and drown in their misery.
		    Vasco fans to drown on Corona beers throughout the night. One of the most historic games in Super league 
		    history! </p><br>
	    
	    <p>Elpesidente is apparently in ER with heart attack whilst Shaka_Zulu is currently on amazon ordering a new controller. We hope 
   to bring you good news about their fortunes soon.</p>
