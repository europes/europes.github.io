   <h3>An analysis of different style full backs.</h3>

<p> 
Today, I cover the subject of the traits of the wing backs. There are 3 types, 
which I'll cover in different comments, so as you will know what is each one and 
choose to your formations the type you want.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>1. Defensive wing back:</strong><br>
	<br>
	<i>Player style:Defensive Full-back.
		A solid full-back who prefers to stay back and stick to defensive duties.</i>
	<br>
	This type is the typical wing back. He is just like any 
other defender, who will cover his position in the wing. As a winger, he has better
 dribble than ball possession. This type is not good in advancing from the side, as 
we are used to see, but he is very good in covering the side. He is mostly useful 
against wing attackers and he offers a good stop to advances from the sides with long balls. 
If you play from the middle, it is good to have this type of wing defender, 
so as not to have holes in your defensive line, even though that means that 
you don't interchange the ball to the sides with the ease you want. 
This type of wing back can also play as CB, where he is normally the low back. 
The defensive wing back has defensive value above his general OPR.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>2. Offensive fullback or simply fullback: </strong><br>
	<br>
	<i>Offensive Full-back.
An attack-minded full back who will run upfield and join the attack when presented with a chance.</i>
	<br>
	The most common wing defender,
 who is exactly what we have in mind when we talk about a wing defender.
 He does cover his position well, but he is a fast and eligible player, 
who can also offer a lot of things in the interchanges in the wing. 
It is common view of a fullback with a long ball to the CFs in an overlap, 
a tactic with which everyone of us is absolutely familiar. Most of the defenders of 
that type as good also as midfielders, even though their OPR in that position is not that 
good as in the defensive position. You can easily recognise a fullback if his defensive 
value is near the value of his OPR or slightly lower, not lower than 5 points.</p><br>

		<p><strong>3. Powerback. </strong><br>
			<br>
	<i>Full-back Finisher.
An attacking full-back who enjoys joining the attack in high central areas.</i>
	<br>
			This is an uncommon type of wing back, since we now go to the midfield area. 
There are not enough wing backs who can play with the same effect as defenders and midfielders, 
let alone attackers. This type of defender has very low value of defense, whereas his abilities 
and traits are close or similar to that of the midfielders. They offer a lot in the attack,
 as they are very good in wing rotation tactics and all the tactics we know, but they remain
 up in the field, thus leaving holes behind. Not ideal when you want mostly to defend, 
but the pressure they give from the back is vital if you want to press forth. They are 
recognised if the defensive value is much lower than their general OPR, with the difference
 higher that 5 points. The most common powerbacks are Marcelo of Real, 
Marcos Acuna of Sporting Lisbon or Alex Grimaldo of Benfica, to have an idea of what I call powerback.</p>
