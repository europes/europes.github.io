<h1>Euro Pes Rules</h1>

		<p>New yellow card system for managers.</p>

		<p>Admins will now have the power to issue yellow and red cards.</p> 

<p>A yellow card is a warning and a 5m transfer fund removal. Two yellows make a red. The first red card you get will result in the forfeiture of 1 match plus 10m fine. Second red card, 3 matches and 25m fine (4 x 5m for equivalent of 4 yellow cards plus 5m additional punishment). 3rd red card and you are removed from the league. 
		</p>
<p>This will be the only way a manager can have negative transfer funds. If a manager has negative funds they can only sell players in the next transfer window until they reach 0. Once 0 is reached they can add players to their squad. Basically whilst at negative funds they cannot trade players. Only sell for funds until they are no longer in negative balance. 
		</p>
<p>At the end of every season one red card (or two yellows) will be removed from your disciplinary file. For example you have a red and yellow card at the end of the season, the red card would be removed leaving you with a yellow card on record. If you have two red cards, one card will be removed leaving you with one on file.
		</p>
		<p>
Match forfeit will be done by random spin between all fixtures you have left to play until the end of the season. If it’s a 3 match ban then it is simply the next round of game week fixtures. 
<p>
The rules: 
		</p>
		<p>
1: Don’t skip opponents goals or replays. You can skip your own if you wish. If an opponent skips a replay, pause and message them on discord asking them to not do it again. If it happens again then report to admins. Punishment:
		<p>1st time = Admin warning.</p>
<p>2nd time= yellow card.</p.>
<p>3rd time red card. </p>

<p>oing afk. Please post that you will be afk if you will be unavailable for more than 5 consecutive days. If you are away and it means your game has to be delayed by a game week without letting other players know then the punishment is:
1st time = yellow card, 2nd time = red card. <p>

3: Record matches. You must record all matches and show you pass assist setting in the menu prior to kick off. Your pass assist must be PA1 or full manual. The full match must be recorded and kept for 3 days after match has been played. If admins request to see recording you must upload video and send the link. If pass assist settings are not shown or there is no recording and you are accused of using PA2/3 or other rule breaking then the punishment is 1st time, yellow card and game must be replayed. 2nd time: red card. 

4: Do not use the kick off goal broken mechanic. Punishment = 1st time - All goals scored in match from mechanic are voided and score is changed to reflect. 2nd time, yellow card plus score change. 3rd time, red card and score change.

5: Using banned formations / tactics. We all know what these are (3x CF/SS, Ultra defensive etc). See Bilal video for reference. First time: Yellow card and game must be replayed. 2nd time: Red card and game is a loss. 3rd time: 3x Red card.

6: Games must be played in the evening and dry weather. First time: Game replayed (if other manager wants) and admin warning). 2nd time: Yellow card. 3rd time: Red card.

7: Being rude or abusive. Just don’t be a dick. Use common sense, different people find different things offensive. Let’s keep it clean and only about football, fun things. If someone is rude to you please don’t respond, take a screenshot and send to admin. Abuse in PM is also not acceptable. Punishment on this one will be at admin discretion due to the subjective nature. But expect at least a yellow card. The Toxic behaviours must stop.

8: You must be active. If you do not respond to a PM about organising a game (unless otherwise afk) then you will be the one at fault if the game isn’t played in the gameweek. First time, admin warning and game loss. Second time red card and game loss. Third time, 3x Red card. Game loss will be against the ignored opponent. 

Transfer Market and Squad rules

1: Missing players: 

Missing players will be replaced before transfer window opens with a like for like. Same position and same rating. You can choose a player of a lower rating but no extra compensation if you make this choice. It is your responsibility to highlight missing players.

Once your player has been replaced that is final. If your player reappears after being removed you will not be allowed to swap back to the original player you had. 

2: Retired players: 

Retired players will not be swapped for a replacement. When the player retires in real life you will be given 50% of their current squad value as cash. You will then keep the player until they are removed from the game. You will not get a replacement once they are removed. You cannot trade or sell the player once the player’s retirement has been announced. They can however be released. 

For example. 82 rated CMF retires but is still in game. Owner of player must alert admin at time of retirement. Admin would then add 50% funds in this case that’s 15m and player would stay in squad with a new mark in the spreadsheet saying “unavailable for transfer”.

It is your responsibility to know when a player retired. If a player retired and is removed from the game you will still only get 50% of the funds and no replacement. If a player retired at 82 rated but you don’t highlight it till they go down to 78 rating then you only get 50% of the 78 rated value. 

If you trade a player who has announced their retirement by mistake a solution depends on whether the market is open or not. If the transfer window is active then the trade / sale will be voided. If the window is not active then new owner will receive 100% funds but no replacement. 

If the player is young and retires unexpectedly they are still a retiring player not a missing player. That’s just unlucky.

3: Upgraded to Black Ball players:

If a player goes BB. The manager will receive 50% of their squad value as cash and a new 83/84 replacement in the same position (CF for CF etc). However if an 83/84 replacement is not available in the exactly the same position. The first option is to then choose from the general playing area. Defenders (CB, LB, RB), Midfield (DMF, CMF, LMF, RMF and AMF) or Forwards (SS, CF, LWF and RWF). A manager can choose a lower rated player but will still only get 50% of squad value back plus the new player. A manager can choose 100% funds but no player if desired. If for example no forwards are available to replace a CF then a manager can select from any position they want but can now select two players but they receive no transfer funds. 

4: BB loans. You will get 1 defensive (GK, LB, RB, CB, DMF, CMF) and 1 offensive (CMF, AMF, LMF, RMF, RWF, LWF, SS, CF) loan players. Loans players can be swapped unlimited times during the first transfer window before the season begins. Swaps can only be defensive for defensive or offensive for offensive. During the mid season window you can only swap one time either defensive or offensive.

5: Changing Team Name/Kits: You can change your team name/kits on one occasion only. You must have been in the league for one full season before you change teams. 

6: Changing Teams: If you want to move to a vacant club then you can do so at the end of the season and before the transfer window opens. If you want to change team you must alert admin and then wait 24 hours after that admin has made it public you wish to take over. If no other applications then the team is yours, if more than one manager is interested then it is random spin. 

When you take over a new team you do not move division. Teams will be adjusted according. For example. You take over a division 2 team but are a division 3 manager. You stay in division 3 but with the new team. The team that finished highest in div 3 and missed out on promotion now gains promotion to div 2. 

7: Low value players.

Players will now be marked as unavailable for transfer in a tab on the spreadsheet. 

Managers can select one player 73 rated or below. To sign a player they must pay the players squad value fee (3m or 5m). 

Managers can only have one low value signing in their squad. 

Low value players cannot be traded or sold. They can only be released. 

If a player goes to 78 rated or above, managers will no longer receive funds for trading them back. The reward for diligent scouting is your now higher rated player. 

Once a manager has signed a free agent player, to sign a new one they must release the current one and then wait till the next transfer window before signing a new one. 

If you release a player you do not get the funds back and must pay again for a new player. 

Players are on a first come first served basis. However once you choose a player you cannot cancel or edit the post. If you change your mind the value of the player you chose will be taken from your funds and you won’t be able to pick again until the next transfer window. If you delete a post and get caught a yellow card will be issued along with a 2 window (1 full season) low value ban. Funds will also be taken for the player signed. 

8: Players can only move one time per transfer window.

9: No loan or swap back deals will be supported or backed by admin. Gentlemen’s agreements only. If it goes wrong then we will not get involved so do so at your own risk.
