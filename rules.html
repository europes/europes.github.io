	<ul class="cards"><li> <span id="yellow">1st yellow card</span>  =  Warning and a 5m transfer fund removal. </li><br>
<li><span id="yellow">2 yellow cards <span id="red"> =  1 red card. </span></li><br>

</ul>

<br>
<p><i>(This will be the only way a manager can have negative transfer funds. If a manager has negative funds they can only sell players in the next transfer window until they reach 0.) 
	</i></p>
<br>
	<p><i>At the end of every season one red card will be removed from your disciplinary file.</i></p>

<br>
<h2>The Rules </h2>
<br>

	<h3>1. Don’t skip opponents goals or replays.</h3><p> You can skip your own if you wish. If an opponent skips a replay, pause and message them on discord asking them to not do it again. If it happens again then report to admins. <br>Punishment:
</p>
<ul><li>1st time = Admin warning.</li>

<li>2nd time= yellow card.</li>

<li>3rd time red card. </li>
</ul>



<br>
	<h3>2. Going afk.</h3> Please post that you will be afk if you will be unavailable for more than 5 consecutive days. If you are away and it means your game has to be delayed by a game week without letting other players know then the punishment is:
</p>
<ul><li>1st time = yellow card,</li><li> 2nd time = red card,</li> <li>3rd time 3x red card.</li></ul>


<p>If you go afk you will be given an extension of the days you will be away. So if you are away for 7 days you will have 7 extra days to play your games. However If you are away for longer than 3 weeks you will be given extension to the end of each half of the season to play your games. All unplayed games will go down as 1-0 loss. No punishment if you announce you will be afk but only if you do it in the correct channel. 
</p>

<p>If you are going afk for full season we hold your team. No transfers, releases auctions or squad changes of any kind during afk period. On return you will play a play off to decide if you return to your previous division.
</p>

<p>If you are putting your team on hold for a season and do so after making deals in the latest transfer window any LVP or retired players you have will be removed even if you didn’t sign them that window. 
</p>
<br>
<p>3. Record matches. You must record all matches and show you pass assist setting in the menu prior to kick off. Your pass assist must be PA1 or full manual. The full match must be recorded and kept for 3 days after match has been played. If admins request to see recording you must upload video and send the link. If pass assist settings are not shown or there is no recording and you are accused of using PA2/3 or other rule breaking then the punishment is 1st time, yellow card and game must be replayed. 2nd time: red card. 
</p>

<p>If you are caught using PA2/3 deliberately then punishment is 1st time red card and game replayed, 2nd time 3x red card. 
</p>

<p>No recording by either manager and a complaint is made then yellow card for both players.
</p>
<br>

<p>4. Do not use the kick off goal broken mechanic. Punishment = 1st time - All goals scored in match from mechanic are voided and score is changed to reflect. 2nd time, yellow card plus score change. 3rd time, red card and score change.
</p>
<br>
<p>5. Using banned formations / tactics. We all know what these are (3x CF/SS, Ultra defensive etc). See <a href="#appendix_a">Appendix</a> A and Bilal video for reference. 
</p>

<ul><li> First time: Yellow card and game must be replayed. </li><li>2nd time: Red card and game is a loss.</li><li> 3rd time: 3x Red card.</li></ul>

<br>
<p>6. Games must be played in the evening and dry weather. If this is an issue please pause game and restart, do not play full game. If you continue to play no action will be taken as a result. If opponent scores when you are waiting for first pause then the goal is void and game restarts in correct settings. If it’s necessary to bring to admin attention, first offence is admin warning, 2nd time yellow card, 3rd time, red card.
</p>
<br>
<p>7. Being rude or abusive. Just don’t be a dick. Use common sense, different people find different things offensive. Let’s keep it clean and only about football, fun things. If someone is rude to you please don’t respond, take a screenshot and send to admin. Abuse in PM is also not acceptable. Punishment on this one will be at admin discretion due to the subjective nature. A period in a mute zone may be given as punishment. 
</p>
<br>
<p>8. Don’t quit matches early. If you disconnect from a match because you are losing and it’s not an internet connection issue or honest mistake. If it is internet or honest mistake game will restart and only the remaining game time will be left (ie disconnect is at 60mins then only 30mins of game time left to play). Scoring deliberate own goals is also not allowed and has the same punishment. Punishment for deliberate quitting/own goals : 1st time: Red Card. 2nd time x2 red card meaning a total of 3 red cards and out of the league. 
</p><br>

<p>9. New managers will take over team and be given transfers funds of whatever is less of 500 squad value. Previous managers funds and competition earnings are removed. If you take over a high value squad you may get no transfer funds but you have inherited strong squad. Any outfield 83/84 players are removed and replaced with transfer funds at full value except for goalkeepers who they can keep. If there is an LVP or retired player then the new manager can choose to keep or trade for full funds but only at the time they take over the club. The minimum transfer funds given to a new manager will be the same as finishing bottom of D3. 
</p>
<br>
<p>10. Gameweek deadlines: 
</p>

<p>All 3 matches should be played each week. However should you not be able to schedule a match we will allow you to carry over ONLY ONE match into the next game week. If it the games are not played by the end of that period then admin will decide who is at fault and result will be allocated based on who has made the most effort to play. If neither manager has made effort then rule 2 will apply. If having specific problems then admin might allow you to extend an extra game but you must PM us for permission.
</p>
<br>
<p>11. Arranging games:</p>


<p>When arranging games you should organise a specific time by private message (remember different time zones). If you fail to show up within reasonable time with no reasonable advanced warning or good reason then you will receive a yellow card as punishment for each offence. 
</p>

<p>If you not turning up means the game misses the deadline then you will receive another yellow card.
</p>

<p>You must also be active. If you do not respond to a PM about organising a game (unless otherwise afk) then you will be the one at fault if the game isn’t played in the gameweek.
</p><br>

<h2>Transfer Market and Squad rules</h2>

<br>
<p>1. Missing players: 
</p>

<p>Missing players will be replaced before transfer window opens with a like for like. Same position and same rating. You can choose a player of a lower rating but no extra compensation if you make this choice. It is your responsibility to highlight missing players.
</p>

<p>Once your player has been replaced that is final. If your player reappears after being removed you will not be allowed to swap back to the original player you had. 
</p>
<br>
<p>2. Retired players: 
</p>

<p>Retired players will not be swapped for a replacement. When the player retires in real life you will be given 100% of their current squad value as transfer funds. You will then keep the player until they are removed from the game. You will not get a replacement once they are removed. You cannot trade or sell the player once the player’s retirement has been announced. They can however be released. 

</p>
<p>For example. 82 rated CMF retires but is still in game. Owner of player must alert admin at time of retirement. Admin would then add 50% funds in this case that’s 15m and player would stay in squad with a new mark in the spreadsheet saying “unavailable for transfer”.
</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to know when a player retired. If a player retired and is removed from the game you will get 100% of the funds and no replacement. If a player retired at 82 rated but you don’t highlight it till they go down to 78 rating then you only get the 78 rated value. 
</p>

<p>If you trade a player who has announced their retirement by mistake a solution depends on whether the market is open or not. If the transfer window is active then the trade / sale will be voided. If the window is not active then new owner will receive 100% funds but no replacement and the original transfer will stand. 
</p>

<p>If the player is young and retires unexpectedly they are still a retiring player not a missing player. That’s just unlucky.
</p>
<br>
<p>3. Upgraded to Black Ball players:
</p>

<p>If a player goes BB. The manager will receive 50% of their squad value as cash and a new 83/84 replacement in the same position (CF for CF etc). However if an 83/84 replacement is not available in the exactly the same position. The first option is to then choose from the general playing area. Defenders (CB, LB, RB), Midfield (DMF, CMF, LMF, RMF and AMF) or Forwards (SS, CF, LWF and RWF). A manager can choose a lower rated player but will still only get 50% of squad value back plus the new player. A manager can choose 100% funds but no player if desired. In the unlikely event that for example no forwards (CF, SS, LWF, RWF) are available to replace a CF then a manager can select from any position they want but can now select two players but they receive no transfer funds. 
</p>
<br>
<p>4. BB loans. You will get 1 defensive (GK, LB, RB, CB, DMF, CMF) and 1 offensive (CMF, AMF, LMF, RMF, RWF, LWF, SS, CF) loan players. Loans players can be swapped unlimited times during the first transfer window before the season begins. Swaps can only be defensive for defensive or offensive for offensive. During the mid season window you can only swap one time either defensive or offensive.
</p>
<br>
<p>5. Changing Team Name/Kits: You can change your team name/kits at the end of the season/start of new one. A specific day for kit changes will be announced and on that day kit changes will be first come first served basis. You must have been in the league for one full season before you change teams. 
</p>
<br>
<p>6. Low value players.
</p>

<p>Players will now be marked as low value player on the spreadsheet. 
</p>

<p>Managers can select one player 73 rated or below. To sign a player they must pay the players squad value fee (3m or 5m). 
</p>

<p>Managers can only have one low value signing in their squad. 
</p>
<p>Low value players under 76 rated cannot be traded or sold. They can only be released. 
</p>

<p>Low Value players that go 76 rated or above can be traded or sold as normal, however they are still classed as a low value player in your squad. You can still only have one low value player in your squad at a time however once a player is sold they are not considered a low value player at the new club. 
</p>

<p>Once a manager has signed a low value free agent player, to sign a new one they must release the current one and then wait till the next transfer window before signing a new one. 
</p>

<p>If you release a player you do not get the funds back and must pay again for a new player. 
</p>

<p>Players are on a first come first served basis. However once you choose a player you cannot cancel or edit the post. If you change your mind the value of the player you chose will be taken from your funds and you won’t be able to pick again until the next transfer window. If you delete a post and get caught a yellow card will be issued along with a 2 window (1 full season) low value ban. Funds will also be taken for the player signed. 
</p>
<br>
<p>7. Players can only move one time per transfer window.
</p>

<p>You cannot release players newly added to your squad signed in the latest transfer window. This applies to any type of signing (LVP, Retired, Auction win or transfer).
</p>
<br>
<p>8. No loan, gentleman’s agreements or swap back deals of any kind will be supported or backed by admin. If it goes wrong then we will not get involved so do so at your own risk. Even if the deal is with an admin and it goes wrong no action will be taken. 
</p>

<p>9. If a manager leaves the league midseason. If they’ve completed first half of the season then that's set in stone and results won’t be altered for that part of the season. Second half of the season split that into two, if played less than 50% of second half then all second half games are voided 1-0. If more than 50% of the second half has been completed only remaining fixtures are voided 1-0. 
</p>

<p>If less than 50% of first half of season has been player then all matches (even played ones) get void. 
</p>
<br>
<p>10. Released players. If you post a released player into the released players tab that is final. Do not delete the post. If you get an offer for a player you have just released or just change your mind that is just unlucky. If you are caught deleting a post about a deleted player it is a yellow card offence. If you are caught more than once it is a red card.
</p>
<br>
<p>11. Retired Free Agent Signing</p>


<p>You can sign a retired free agent. </p>

<p>The player must be retired in real life and not be in another managers squad. The player cannot be traded or sold. You can release or wait until they are removed. When they are removed you will NOT receive the usual retired player compensation. The cost to sign a retired player is their current value. 
</p>

<p>For example 77 rated LWF has a 20m value. The cost to sign him would be 20m. </p>


<p>Signings are on a first come basis. </p>


<p>You can only sign one retired free agent per season. </p>
